## Retrospective Plans

# Glad, Sad, Mad 
Is a very basic retrospective plan and it takes up to 60 minutes. The team members first list their 
observations made during the sprint and categorize them into three categories: Glad, Sad and Mad. Making them positive, negative
and "angry". The mad category requires to observe things that might be out of the teams control. 
Then the team members vote which of the observations they will discuss together. The issues are disgussed in 
descending order of votes, meaning that the most voted issue is discussed first. Each step should be timed to keep the whole
retrospective in schedule.

# Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel
Another retrospective plan is the Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel. It is shorter than the Glad, Sad, Mad plan.
This method uses onpen-ended feedback from the team members. They draw a circle and divide it into five parts. Each part is
labeled with one of the five categories (Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of). The facilator will first ask "What should 
we start doing that we have not done yet".
